# Step-by-Step Guide to Creating the UCLA 3D Osteology Website

This document provides a comprehensive guide to creating and maintaining the UCLA 3D Osteology Collection website. Follow these steps to set up the website from scratch or make updates to the existing site.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning, ensure you have the following:

- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- A text editor or IDE (Visual Studio Code recommended)
- Git for version control
- Access to the project repository
- Basic understanding of 3D model formats and Sketchfab

## Step 1: Set Up Project Structure

1. Create a new project directory:
   ```
   mkdir ucla-3d-osteology-website
   cd ucla-3d-osteology-website
   ```

2. Initialize the project structure:
   ```
   mkdir -p css js images pages/collections data
   ```

3. Initialize Git repository:
   ```
   git init
   ```

4. Create a `.gitignore` file:
   ```
   # .gitignore
   .DS_Store
   node_modules/
   .vscode/
   *.log
   ```

## Step 2: Create Base CSS Styles

1. Create the main CSS file at `css/styles.css` with:
   - CSS variables for colors, fonts, and spacing
   - Reset and base styles
   - Typography styles
   - Layout components (container, grid, sections)
   - Navigation styles
   - Component styles (cards, buttons, tabs, etc.)
   - Responsive design rules

2. Link to Google Fonts for typography:
   - Montserrat for headings
   - Open Sans for body text

## Step 3: Create JavaScript Functionality

1. Create the main JavaScript file at `js/main.js` with:
   - Navigation functionality
   - Tab system
   - Accordion system
   - Search functionality
   - Scroll animations

2. Create the 3D model viewer integration at `js/model-viewer.js` with:
   - Sketchfab API integration
   - Model loading functionality
   - Viewer controls
   - Citation generator

## Step 4: Create HTML Pages

1. Create the homepage (`index.html`) with:
   - Header with navigation
   - Hero section with mission statement
   - Introduction section
   - Featured collections grid
   - Ethical framework preview
   - Footer with links and contact information

2. Create the main section pages:
   - `pages/about.html`
   - `pages/ethical-framework.html`
   - `pages/methodology.html`
   - `pages/collections.html`
   - `pages/bibliography.html`
   - `pages/resources.html`
   - `pages/contact.html`

3. Create collection-specific pages:
   - `pages/collections/axial.html`
   - `pages/collections/appendicular.html`
   - `pages/collections/pathological.html`
   - `pages/collections/whole-spine.html`

## Step 5: Implement 3D Model Integration

1. Register for a Sketchfab account if you don't already have one

2. Upload 3D models to Sketchfab:
   - Use OBJ format with texture maps
   - Set appropriate model settings (background, lighting, etc.)
   - Add annotations to highlight key features
   - Set appropriate licensing and visibility settings

3. Integrate models into the website:
   - Add model containers to collection pages
   - Link to Sketchfab models using their IDs
   - Implement viewer controls
   - Add citation functionality

## Step 6: Add Content and Ethical Considerations

1. Add detailed content to each page based on:
   - Current UCLA 3D Osteology Collection information
   - Research papers on ethical considerations
   - NAGPRA and CalNAGPRA regulations
   - 3D scanning methodology documentation

2. Ensure ethical considerations are prominently featured:
   - Create a dedicated ethical framework page
   - Include NAGPRA compliance information
   - Highlight non-invasive research methods
   - Address data privacy and security
   - Discuss educational value and ethical pedagogy

3. Create a comprehensive bibliography:
   - Academic sources
   - Digital resources
   - Institutional resources
   - Citation guidelines

## Step 7: Optimize Images and Assets

1. Prepare images for the website:
   - Optimize for web (compress, resize)
   - Use appropriate formats (WebP for photos, SVG for icons)
   - Create responsive versions for different screen sizes

2. Create logo and branding assets:
   - Main logo (color and white versions)
   - Favicon
   - Social media images

## Step 8: Test and Optimize

1. Test the website across different devices and browsers:
   - Desktop (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
   - Mobile (iOS, Android)
   - Tablets

2. Optimize performance:
   - Minimize CSS and JavaScript
   - Lazy load images and 3D models
   - Implement caching strategies

3. Ensure accessibility:
   - Add proper ARIA attributes
   - Ensure keyboard navigation
   - Provide alternative text for images
   - Maintain sufficient color contrast

## Step 9: Deployment

1. Prepare for deployment:
   - Verify all links work correctly
   - Check for any missing assets
   - Validate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

2. Deploy to hosting:
   - Upload files to web server
   - Configure domain settings
   - Set up SSL certificate

3. Post-deployment tasks:
   - Test the live site
   - Set up analytics
   - Create a backup system

## Step 10: Documentation and Maintenance

1. Create documentation:
   - This step-by-step guide
   - Content update procedures
   - 3D model addition guidelines

2. Establish maintenance procedures:
   - Regular content updates
   - Security patches
   - Performance monitoring
